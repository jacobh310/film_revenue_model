# Introduction
---
Production companies and studios alike always aim for the biggest budget often disregarding creative integrity. Often times these studios resort to uncreative ideas like reboots, endless sequels, and book adaptations. These attempts are often seen as a cash grab to the more savy film audience. This projects devles deeper into what characteristics correlate with higher box office revenues. The data is for this project is scrapped of Wikipedia which often had ranges for their box office and budgets so take these results with a grain of salt. In the final part of the project, I built a model that predicts box office revenues
